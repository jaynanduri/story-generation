# Fine-Tuned Language Models Using Facebook AI Research Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to leverage the power of pre-trained transformers, such as BERT, GPT-2, and LLAMA, to build a fine-tuned language model (LLM). Our approach utilizes a comprehensive dataset published by the Facebook AI research team, which includes 300,000 stories and prompts. This rich dataset allows us to explore and enhance the capabilities of language models in understanding and generating complex narrative structures.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by Facebook AI research consists of 300,000 stories accompanied by prompts. These narratives cover a wide range of themes and styles, providing a robust foundation for training our language models. The dataset is structured to facilitate easy integration with machine learning models and is ideal for tasks such as text generation, story completion, and narrative analysis.

## Objectives
- To fine-tune existing pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, LLAMA) using the provided dataset.
- To enhance the models' ability to understand and generate coherent and contextually relevant stories.
- To evaluate the performance of these models in narrative generation and completion tasks.
- To explore innovative applications of these fine-tuned models in various domains such as creative writing, content generation, and more.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring the dataset for optimal use in training.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, LLAMA) as the base for fine-tuning.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting the models on the dataset, focusing on narrative understanding and generation capabilities.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models' performance using metrics suitable for narrative text.
5. **Application Development**: Exploring practical applications of the fine-tuned models.
